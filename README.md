## Limitations
- Limited Translation Scope: This project does not utilize any external APIs for translation, limiting the scope of translations to only a selected set of words. As a result, users may not find translations for all words they search for.
- Manual Data Management: Words and translations are stored locally in the selfDict.js file, requiring manual updates for new entries or modifications. This may lead to potential inconsistencies or outdated information in the dictionary.
- Word Reference: If a word is not found in the translated dictionary, users can click on the word to access additional translation resources. A pop-up message will appear, prompting users to click for more information. Upon clicking, users will be redirected to an external site where they can find the translation of the selected word.

#### Note: While D-Dragoman offers valuable translation and dictionary features, it's important to acknowledge these limitations. We continuously strive to enhance the project and welcome contributions to improve its functionality and reliability.
