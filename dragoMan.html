            <p><b>Dragoman</b>: A linguistic mediator facilitating communication between different language-speaking
                communities.
            </p>
            <p>A dragoman was someone who helped people communicate and navigate between countries like Turkey,
                Arabic-speaking places,
                and Persia, and European embassies or trading spots. They needed to know languages like Arabic, Persian,
                Turkish, and
                European ones.</p>
            <p>In the Ottoman Empire, dragomans were often from the Greek community. They were chosen because they could
                speak many
                languages, which was useful since Greeks did a lot of trading around the Mediterranean, Black Sea,
                Atlantic
                Ocean, and
                Indian Ocean. Sometimes, people from other communities like Armenians were also hired for this job.</p>
